# QuizMe

This is a simple quiz application developed using ReactJS, based on the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq-fCtg_gG4) by Knowledgehut

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites set up on your local system.

* Current LTS version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) version 16.0+

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Create and navigate into a new directory anywhere on your file system through the command line. Then, run the following command.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/keerthisree-raghu/QuizMe.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run the following command.

```shell
npm install
```

## Usage

### Development Server

Navigate to the `src` folder and run `npm start` or `yarn start` to run the development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Build

Use `npm build` or `yarn build` to build the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
